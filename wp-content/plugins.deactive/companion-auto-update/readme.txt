This plugin automatically updates all plugins, all themes and the wordpress core in the background.

== Description ==

= Keep your website safe! =
We understand that you might not always be able to check if your wordpress site has any updates that need to be installed, especially when you maintain multiple websites keeping them up-to-date can be a lot of work.
This plugin enables background auto-updating for all plugins, all themes and the wordpress core (both major and minor updates). 
We give you full control over what is updated and what isn't, via the settings page you can easily disallow auto-updating for either plugins, themes or wordpress core.

= Available settings =
Full control, that's what this plugin is all about. We offer settings to enable or disable automatic updating for plugins, themes, wordpress core updates (both minor and major can be changed separately) and for translation files.

= Know what's happening =
We want you to know what's happening on your website. This plugin offers settings for various email notifications. We can send you an email when an update is available, when a plugin has been updated or when wordpress has been updated.
But if you don't want to recieve emails about this you can still log in and view the changelog to see what happened.

= Advanced Controls =
You might not want to update all plugins or themes automatically, no problem! With the advanced filters you can easily select single plugins and/or themes that you want the plugin to skip. We can notify you when one of the selected plugins has an update ready so you can then head over to your dashboard and update them manually.

= Scheduling =
By default the updater will run twice a day, but you can change this to every hour or to daily. When set to daily you can even set the time at which it should run, this way you can make sure that it will not overload your server by letting it run at times with less activity. The same settings can be set for notifications.
